# fontforgelibs
This repository contains a bunch of scripts to make packages for all of the
supplemental libraries required by FontForge that are not in the default
MSYS2 repository.

At present, this repository contains `libspiro`, `libuninameslist`, the
X11 suite of libraries and versions of Cairo and Pango that have been compiled
with X11 support.
